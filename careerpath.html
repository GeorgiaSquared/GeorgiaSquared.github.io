	    <h2>Qualities</h2>
	    <p>
		The Occupational Outlook Handbook states, “Cartographers and photogrammetrists collect, measure, and interpret geographic information in order to create and update maps and charts for regional planning, education, and other purposes” (Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2019a). Many cartographers and photogrammetrists use GIS technology (Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2019a). The Occupational Outlook Handbook provides a list of a few important qualities that are needed in a cartographers today: computer skills, critical-thinking skills, decision making skills, problem-solving skills, and someone who is detail oriented (BLS, 2019b). 
	    </p>
	    <h2>Job Requirements</h2>
	    <p>
		As of May 2018, The median annual wage for cartographers and photogrammetrists was $64,430. The Occupational Outlook Handbook states, "The lowest 10 percent earned less than $40,960, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $101,400." The top paying industry for cartographers and photogrammetrists is the federal government with a median annual wage of $91,910. (BLS, 2019d). 
	    </p>
	    <h2>Educational Requirements</h2>
	    <p>
		The Occupational Outlook Handbook suggests someone getting into the field pursue a bachelor’s degree in either cartography, geography, geomatics, or surveying. (BLS, 2019b). 
	    <p>
		The Occupational Outlook Handbook cites that there are many different certifications a GIS professional can acquire to aid them in demonstrating competence when getting a job. A common one is the GISP certification (BLS, 2019b). 
	    </p>
	    </p>
	    <h2>Fields Implementing GIS</h2>
	    <p>
		The Occupational Outlook Handbook says that maps are used to provide support for decisions involving environmental studies, geology, engineering, land-use planning, and business marketing (BLS, 2019a). Even though most fields can and continue to benefit from GIS and mapping, 33% of the 11,800 jobs held by cartographers and photogrammetrists were in local government (BLS, 2019c). 
	    </p>
	    <h2>Changes in Technologies</h2>
	    <p>
		With GIS changing, cartographers and photogrammetrists need to continue to educate themselves in regards to computer programming, engineering, math, GIS technology, surveying, and geography in order to keep up. Working with computer data and coding is essential to the longevity of someone in the industry (BLS, 2019b).
