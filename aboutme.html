    <h1>About Me</h1>
	<div class="paratext">
    	<p>
     	 Seeking a degree at Delaware Technical Community College in Geographic Information Systems Technology has given me a taste of 
     	 higher education but has left me hungry for more. 
  	  </p>
  	  <p>
   	   When becoming a Delaware Tech student in the spring of 2018 I also started under the wing of my academic advisor and teacher. 
   	   She gave me the resources to learn time management skills, build my resume, and understand what putting in a day of 
   	   hard work really meant to me. My advisors insistence towards me graduating whilst undergoing all of the 
   	   turmoil and hardship fueled the fire within me and solidified the importance of higher education. 
     	 </p>
    	  <p>
    	  Throughout my associates I have progressed from being a part time student who worked as a barista 40+ hours a week to now having 
    	  a 21-credit course load while working as a GIS Intern at New Castle County. My skill set has reached heights I was not privy to 
    	  before and now includes the ESRI suite of GIS software, Python, and raster image processing. I have presented at several 
    	  professional GIS conferences, such as the Delaware User Group (DUG) and the Delaware Geographic Data Committee (DGDC), 
   	   with projects I have completed through school and my internship. Now that I am coming to the end of my time Delaware Tech, 
   	   I can reflect on how far I have come and feel proud of every assignment I have the privilege to put my name on.
   	   </p>
   	   <p>
  	    My next step will be attending University of Delaware, where I see myself expanding my knowledge of GIS while continuing 
   	   to grow as a person. I will continue to present at GIS conferences and will continue to be the change I would like 
   	   to see in the world.
